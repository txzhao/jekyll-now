### Brief bio

Hej! I'm currently starting my second year of master studies at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. And I'll be hunting for a full-time job related to machine learning or deep learning in the following months. You can find my resume [here](https://github.com/txzhao/txzhao.github.io/blob/master/images/Tianxiao%20Zhao-cv.pdf). In my spare time, I love scene photography. You can find some of my photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/people/147454934@N08/).
